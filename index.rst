Nightcaste 0.3 Alpha Documentation
======================================

**Nightcaste** is a 2D Console-based Roguelike game.
It is based on classics such as *Rogue* and *Ancient Domains of Mystery* aka *ADOM*.

The setting, story, many characters and the game rules are based on the **Exalted Role Playing Game** by *White Wolf Publishing*

Setting
----------

In **Nightcaste** you play a *Solar Exalted*, a Demigod, chosen by the Unconquered Sun. Once the masters of Creation, the Solars were betrayed and usurped by their trusted advisors and soldiers, the *Dragon-Blooded*, which are weaker in power, though much stronger in Numbers. The *Dragon-Blooded* wield powers dedicated to the Five Elemental Poles: Air, Water, Fire, Earth and Wood, which they utilize to pursue the *Solar Exalted*, among others, in the so called *Wyld Hunt*. You, as a Solar Exalted are roaming the Creation, in search for First Age Artifacts, infused with ancient powers, to defend yourself, not only against the *Dragon-Blooded*, but also all the other dangers that lie in the Fields, Caverns and Cities of the Creation.
